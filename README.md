# MagicSchool
Final project on the course at Coders Lab. 

The project is about creating a game. In this game, the user travels to the realm of magic by creating his own wizard character. By participating in the game, the user develops his character, learns and creates new spells, competes with other players, and also works for a place in the University's ranking. The main goal of the game, however, is to develop and expand your knowledge by participating in this game.
